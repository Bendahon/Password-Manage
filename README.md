# Password-Manager
Simple Password manager using AES encryption

Update Jan 2020, I tried to redo the code and switch it to class based rather than have everything in the event handler. Wasted a day doing it, stupid bugs i cant solve. This does work but it sucks from what i know now. Anyone else is welcome to have a go


I wrote this a while back (2018) when i was first learning to code in C#, i've learnt more since then so parts will look terrible, other bits should look ok

All files install under C:\Bendahon\PasswordManager\


Any feedback always appreciated :)
